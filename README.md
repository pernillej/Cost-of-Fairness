# Investigating the Cost of Fairnessin Automated Decision Making Systems
My master thesis project. Uses multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and Pareto fronts to investigate the cost of fairness in automated decision making systems. Inspired by:
- Haas, C. (2019).  The Price of Fairness - A Framework to Explore Trade-Offs in Algorithmic Fairness.  In 40th  International  Conference  on  Information  Systems, ICIS 2019, pages 1â€“17

## Requirements
This code is verified to run using:

- Python 3.7.3
- Modules:

|Module      |Version|Notes|
|------------|-------|-----|
|numpy       |1.16.4 |     |
|scikit-learn|0.21.2 |     |
|aif360      |0.2.3  |     |
|pandas      |0.24.2 |At the time of writing the code appears incompatible with the newest versions of pandas. We believe this is because of the pandas version used by aif360.|
|matplotlib  |3.1.0  |     |
